Create a modern system architecture diagram for a Quantum Computing Job Management Dashboard with the following structure:

**Top Layer - Frontend (React Application)**
- Landing Page with hero section and features
- Authentication system (login/signup with protected routes)
- Main Dashboard with job management, analytics, and real-time monitoring
- Quantum Quest page with tutorials, challenges, and simulations
- Teamwork collaboration page

**Frontend Technology Stack**
- React + TypeScript with Vite build system
- TanStack Query for state management
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS for design
- Wouter for routing
- Framer Motion for animations
- Next-themes for dark mode

**Middle Layer - Express.js Backend Server**
- API Routes: /api/jobs, /api/sessions, /api/analytics, /api/workspaces
- WebSocket server for real-time collaboration
- Request logging and error handling middleware
- Vite integration for development mode

**Services Layer (7 specialized services)**
- AI Collaboration Service (team insights, suggestions, chat bot)
- Smart Notification Service (contextual alerts, batch processing)  
- Advanced Analytics Service (performance metrics, quantum statistics)
- Gamification Service (achievements, challenges, leaderboards)
- Real-time Collaboration Service (WebSocket management, document sync)
- IBM Quantum Service (Qiskit Runtime API, job queue, backend list)
- OpenAI Service (GPT-4o Mini, circuit analysis, failure analysis)

**Storage Layer**
- In-Memory Storage with IStorage interface
- Data Maps: Jobs, Sessions, Workspaces, Analytics, Projects, Users, Notifications, Achievements
- Drizzle Schema Layer with TypeScript types and Zod validation
- PostgreSQL-ready structure (currently in-memory)

**External Integrations**
- IBM Quantum Platform (Qiskit Runtime API with token authentication)
- OpenAI Platform (GPT-4o Mini for AI features)
- WebSocket connections for real-time features
- Browser LocalStorage for auth tokens and preferences

**Data Flow Arrows showing:**
- Frontend ↔ REST API calls via TanStack Query
- API Routes → Services → Storage Layer
- WebSocket real-time communication
- External API integrations with graceful fallbacks

**Visual Style:**
- Use modern blue and purple color scheme for quantum theme
- Show clear separation between layers with distinct sections
- Use arrows to show data flow and connections
- Include icons for: quantum circuits, AI, real-time, storage, external APIs
- Make it clean, professional, and easy to follow top-to-bottom
- Add small technology logos where appropriate (React, Express, etc.)

**Key Features to Highlight:**
- Full-stack TypeScript architecture
- Real-time collaboration capabilities  
- AI-powered quantum assistance
- Comprehensive job management
- Interactive learning platform
- Production-ready deployment
