Admin Dashboard – Professional Product Prompt

You are a senior product designer and full-stack engineer. Design and implement a modern, responsive Admin Dashboard for our project. The dashboard must let admins manage landing-page pricing and content, users (including premium vs. standard), news items on the dashboard, and each user’s job submissions, teamwork projects, and game scores. It should follow best-in-class UX patterns (e.g., Stripe, Linear, Notion) and look polished and “advanced”.

Objectives

Make daily admin tasks fast, safe, and auditable.

Provide at-a-glance insights with rich visualizations.

Support content/pricing edits that instantly reflect on the public landing page and docs.

Primary Features
1) Pricing Management (Landing Page)

View and edit all active plans: name, monthly/yearly price, features, limits, trial, status.

Versioning & draft → review → publish flow; show change history and rollback.

Optional A/B test flag per plan (target % + start/end date).

Preview panel showing how the pricing table will render on the site.

2) Landing Page & Docs Content

WYSIWYG/Markdown editor with sections (hero, features, FAQs, footers, docs pages).

Per-section versioning, diff view, scheduled publish, and revert.

Link checker and “SEO hints” (title length, meta desc, headings).

Media library (images/icons) with alt-text and usage references.

3) User Management

Top summary cards: Total Users, Premium, Standard, 7-day signups, Churn.

Filterable/sortable user table (search by email/ID, plan, status, signup date, activity).

User detail view:

Notes & internal tags.

Bulk actions (email, plan changes, export CSV).

4) News Management (Dashboard Announcements)

Create/edit/publish news items that show on the admin dashboard (title, body, tags, visibility, pin to top, expiry).

Schedule posts; archive; view analytics (impressions/clicks).

5) Game Score Tracking

Per-user line chart of scores over time; best score, streaks, percentile.

Leaderboard with filters (time window, cohort, plan).

7) Governance & Safety

Role-based access control (Super Admin, Content Admin, Support).

Audit log for all mutations (who/what/when/before/after, IP).

Draft/review/publish workflow and required approvals for pricing/content.

Nice-to-Have/“Delight” Ideas

What-if simulator: tweak plan price and see projected MRR impact.

Content health: stale sections warning (no update in >90 days).

Feature flags: toggle specific homepage blocks by audience/plan.

User 360 timeline: unified event stream (signups, jobs, scores, plan changes).

UX & UI Requirements

Clean, high-contrast layout; dark/light modes; keyboard navigation; WCAG AA.

Global search (⌘K / Ctrl-K) across users, plans, docs, news.

Consistent empty states, loading skeletons, toasts, and confirmation modals.

Use cards, tabs, data grids, and a right-side details drawer for quick edits.
